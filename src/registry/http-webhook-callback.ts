/**
 * `HttpWebhookCallback`
 *
 * The standard Node.js HTTP handler signature used by grammY when
 * running in **webhook mode**.
 *
 * - Accepts a Node `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse`.
 * - Returns a `Promise<void>`, so it can be awaited or used in async contexts.
 *
 * Typically passed to HTTP frameworks (like Express, Fastify, Nestâ€™s
 * raw server) as a request handler.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const callback: HttpWebhookCallback = bot.webhookCallback("http");
 * http.createServer(callback).listen(3000);
 * ```
